## Prerequisite

- You need an [IBM Cloud](http://cloud.ibm.com/) account. If you don't have an account, create one [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration/).

## Create an instance of App Configuration Service
- Log in to your IBM Cloud account.
- In the [IBM Cloud catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog#services), search **App Configuration** and select [App Configuration](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/apprapp). The service configuration screen opens.
- **Select a region** - Currently, Dallas (us-south) and London (eu-gb) region is supported.
- Select a pricing plan, resource group and configure your resource with a service name, or use the preset name.
- Click **Create**. A new service instance is created and the App Configuration console displayed.

## Setup the app
### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your machine.
- jq - command-line JSON processor. Install it from [here](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/).

### Next steps
- Download the source code
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/examplepath/examplepath
    cd <repoistory name>
    ```
- Setup or configure your app configuration service instance
    - Navigate to dashboard of your app configuration instance.
    - Go to Service credentials section and generate a new set of credentials. Note down the `apikey` and `guid`. These credentials are required in the next steps.
    - From your terminal, inside the source code exceute the `demo.sh` script by running below command
        ```
        ./demo.sh
        ```
    - Provide all the inputs during script excecution. A sample example is shown in below figure
      <img src="README_IMG1.png" width=75% height=50%/>
    - Script execution takes time. Script is executed successfully only when you see the log `---Demo script complete---` at the end in your terminal.
- Edit the configuration values in file [`server.js`](server.js)
    - Replace `region`, `guid` & `apikey` at [line 21](server.js#L21) with the values you obtained from the Service credentials section of the instance.
- Installing Dependencies
    - Run `npm install` from the root folder to install the appâ€™s dependencies.

## Run the app locally
- Run `npm start` to start the app
- Access the running app in a browser at http://localhost:3000


## Test the app with feature toggle and segmentation
- Explain feature toggle use case 1
- Explain feature toggle use case 2
- Explain feature toggle use case 3
